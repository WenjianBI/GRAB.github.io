SAIGE is an R package developed with Rcpp for genome-wide association tests in large-scale data sets and biobanks. The method

- accounts for sample relatedness based on the generalized mixed models
- allows for model fitting with either full or sparse genetic relationship matrix (GRM)
- works for quantitative and binary traits
- handles case-control imbalance of binary traits
- computationally efficient for large data sets
- performs single-variant association tests
- provides effect size estimation more accurate than estimation with score tests

SAIGE-GENE and SAIGE-GENE+ are new method extension in the R package for testing rare variant in set-based tests.
- performs BURDEN, SKAT, and SKAT-O tests
- allows for tests on multiple minor allele frequencies cutoffs and functional annotations
- performs conditional analysis to identify associations independent from nearly GWAS signals

The package take genotype file input in the following formats

- PLINK (bed, bim, fam), BGEN, VCF, BCF, SAV
